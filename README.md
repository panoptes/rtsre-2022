# Welcome to the PANOPTES Workshop - RTSRE-2022

**Welcome to the [PANOPTES workshop](https://rtsre.space/rtsre-workshops-2022/) for [RTSRE 2022](https://rtsre.space/)!**


This repository contains a few notebooks that demonstrate how to work with PANOPTES observations.

## Notebooks

The notebooks are contained in the `notebooks` folder, along with a `helpers.py` file that is used by many of the notebooks.

The following notebooks are available:

| Notebook | Desc |
|----------|------|
| [Get Raw Images](notebooks/Get%20Raw%20Images.ipynb) | Search for a particular observation, get image metadata and see how to download FITS files.
| [Stack Observation](notebooks/Stack%20Observation.ipynb) | Make a simple image stack from a cutout of the data.
| [Horizon Limits](notebooks/Horizon%20Obstruction%20Limits.ipynb) | Demonstrates how the PANOPTES scheduler tries to avoid objects on the horizon.

## Using the notebooks

This assumes you are running the notebooks in a [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) environment, but most of the features should be available regardless of where they are run.
